# Music/FunApp
This project is made with the Java programming language.
It was made as an assignment for a certified project centered course on Courseera about Android app development. 

This is a music/fun app made with media player which plays the famous "Hadal Ahbek" arabic song. 
The user can also rate it with stars, and then be taken to a second activity with a message of how many stars he rated the song. 
In addition to that I've added a seekbar color changer for an image which the user can have fun with. 
The user can also play, pause and turn on the loop switcher for the song.
